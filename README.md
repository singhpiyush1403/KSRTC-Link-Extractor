# KSRTC-Link-Extractor
This project uses Selenium WebDriver in Java to extract all hyperlink texts from the KSRTC website. It prints only the non-empty link texts to avoid blank results. Additionally, the script displays the webpage title and current URL for verification. A practical example for learning web element handling and link extraction using Selenium.
